# Progress

Update after every completed task. At session start, read this + `CLAUDE.md`.

## Status: Auth + channels + messages + WebSocket + presence + shipments + DMs done (69 tests green). Next: AI summarization.

## Priority order (protect top to bottom under time pressure)
1. **Core chat loop** — auth, channels, post/receive message in real time, presence. (non-negotiable)
2. **DMs** (virtual channels) + reconnect replay (`after_id`).
3. **Shipment surface** — `SHIP-0xx` parsing + card + `/shipments/{ref}`.
4. **AI summarization** ("Catch me up") with streaming + cache + fallback.
5. **Backend tests** — auth, channels, messages, AI (mocked LLM).
6. **README + Loom + Docker polish.**
- Stretch (only if all above done): delay detection (2nd AI feature).

## Checklist
- [x] docker-compose (Postgres + Redis) + `.env`
- [x] Backend scaffold (`main.py`, `db.py`, `config.py`)
- [x] Models + async Alembic env.py configured
- [x] Initial migration (`ca9481fbf6e9`) — all 5 tables + indexes applied
- [x] Seed (channels, 2 users, 10 shipments) — `app/seed.py`
- [x] Auth module (schemas, JWT, `get_current_user`, register/login) — `app/auth.py`, `app/routers/auth.py`
- [x] Channels router (list/create/join/leave/read, exclude is_dm, unread count) — `app/routers/channels.py` + `tests/test_channels.py`
- [x] Messages router (POST + cursor history, Redis publish, sender read-cursor advance) — `app/routers/messages.py` + `tests/test_messages.py`
- [x] WebSocket `/api/ws` + ConnectionManager + Redis pub/sub fan-out — `app/routers/ws.py` + `tests/test_ws.py`
- [x] Presence (lazy last_seen+TTL, heartbeat, `GET /api/presence`) — included in ws.py
- [x] DMs (find-or-create virtual channel, both memberships) — `app/routers/dm.py` + `tests/test_dms.py`
- [x] Shipments router (`GET /api/shipments/{ref}`, case-insensitive, 404 on miss) — `app/routers/shipments.py` + `tests/test_shipments.py`
- [ ] AI summarization (Gemini stream → requester WS, cache, fallback)
- [ ] Frontend: `lib/xhr.ts`, `lib/api.ts`, auth context, useWebSocket hook
- [ ] Frontend screens: login/register (XHR), channel list+unread, channel view, DM view, shipment card, presence dots, AI summary panel
- [ ] Tests: auth, channels, messages, AI (mocked)
- [ ] README (setup, architecture, AI justification, tradeoffs, production)
- [ ] Loom 3–5 min

## Current task
AI summarization — `POST /api/channels/{id}/summarize`: fetch last 50 messages, stream Gemini Flash chunks to requester's WS as `ai_summary` events (never to channel topic), Redis 5-min cache, fallback on error, correlation id. Test with mocked LLM.

## Notes / blockers
- Verify current Gemini Flash model id before wiring AI.
- **passlib dropped** — bcrypt 5.x broke passlib's backend probe; auth.py now calls `bcrypt` directly.
- **Channel name has no DB unique constraint** — create endpoint does a soft duplicate check (racy under concurrency). If it matters later: add a partial unique index `WHERE is_dm=false`.
- **No channel discovery endpoint** — GET lists only *joined* channels. Fine for demo (seed joins both users to all). Revisit if "browse channels" is needed.
